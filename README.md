# DynamicGestureRecognition

### Mithesh Ramachandran

Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition has seen a lot of advancements in the recent years. Unlike static gesture recognition, dynamic gestures combine the Spatio temporal data of the hands and fingers to predict gestures. This generally requires using a depth image with 3-D coordinates. In case of a 2-D image, the 3-D coordinates must be projected onto the image plane. For gesture recognition systems to be more accessible, they must include ability to run with limited hardware and ease of recording gestures and training them. In this paper we focus on methods to recognize dynamic gestures. We also contribute:
1.	A dataset for dynamic gesture recognition
2.	An open source no code platform to record, process and train dynamic gestures.
